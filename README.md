# Schrodinger-Equation-Solver
## Time Independent Schrodinger Equation Solve using MATLAB with wave plots of electron in finite and infinite well
The Time Inpendent Schrondinger Equation of this project is a 2nd order differential equation. To solve this equation Finite Difference Method has been used. After applying this method to the Time Inpendent Schrondinger Equation, it simplifies into Hψ = Eψ equation, where H is the Hamiltonian matrix, ψ is the wave function of the particle and E is the Energy. H matrix is constructed with the coefficients of the main equation. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of H matrix is our desired solution of the wavefunction and corresponding energy. 
Necessary assumptions for constants and required parameters are made for this project as told in instruction for simplification. Depending on the well type being finite or infinite, this project can show plot for any wavefunction and energy state if it exists as well as prints the energy values for those states. If the wavefunction doesn’t exist in the well, the code returns a comment in the output. But for larger values of potential or well width the plots become congested and hard to observe. So, to avoid this problem, users are asked to enter inputs from a range specified in the input text. Overall, it can be assured that this project works properly according to the inputs given.
